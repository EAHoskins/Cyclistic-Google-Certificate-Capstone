Data cleaning in Excel 
Each monthly Divvy file was cleaned in Excel in the following ways:
	- Deleted columns: start_station_id, end_station_idj, start_station_name, and end_station_name
	- Looked for blanks in the following columns: member_casual, ride_id, started_at, and ended_at. No blanks were foiund 
	- Removed rows where end_lab and end_lng were blanks
	- Created new column ride_length:
		- subtracted end_at from start_at
		- Converted cells to HH:MM:SS
		- Checked for cells with negative values - none wree found
		- for instances where start_at was before end_at, cells were switched 
		- removed values where value was 0:00:00
		- Removed ride_lengths where values were <24 hours
	- Created column for day of the week using formula (=weekday(C2, 1))
		- Confirmed data values were correct
	- Split start_at and end_at by data and time. Deleted time columns (could not be read into SQL)
